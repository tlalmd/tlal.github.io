I am a third-year General Surgery resident at Case Western Reserve/University Hospitals. My future aspirations involve a career in academic surgical oncology. In order to achieve this goal, I am dedicating two additional years of residency to academic development time after my second clinical year so that I can develop a prolific research portfolio and be a competitive applicant for fellowship.\nAs a medical student at Howard University College of Medicine, a historically black college/university, completing my clinical rotations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic brought the alarming healthcare disparities that my patients to the foreground. I learned how to be a compassionate and culturally competent physician in that environment, and I aim to carry that with me throughout my career.\nI started my academic development time in July 2024 and have hit the ground running. My primary mentor is Dr. Richard Hoehn, an academic surgical oncologist at UH who shares my passion for health equity. We have been working on various projects involving topics like financial toxicity, social vulnerability, and barriers to cancer care. Additionally, I am pursuing a Master’s in Clinical Research through Case Western Reserve University during this time in order to solidify my foundation in health services research.\nOutside of work, I enjoy cooking, painting, yoga, and running. I love to travel and hope to do more of it during this two-year hiatus. I’m also a big Celtics fan, fortunately.\nOn this website, you will find a list of my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "Study 1\nAnalysis A: Does smoking influence HDL cholesterol levels?\nThe paired variables I chose to compare are HDL cholesterol (LBDHDD, measured in mg/dL) in smokers from the 2017-2020 NHANES dataset with those who stopped smoking in the 2021-2024 NHANES dataset.\nThe null hypothesis for this analysis is that there is no difference in mean HDL cholesterol levels between smokers (2017-2020) and non-smokers (2021-2023). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in between HDL cholesterol levels between smokers (2017-2020) and non-smokers (2021-2023).\nExisting research indicates that smoking tends to lower HDL cholesterol levels, which is often referred to as “good” cholesterol. Low HDL cholesterol levels have been associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which drive carcinogenesis. By running this paired analysis, we can explore whether smoking is associated with significant changes in “good cholesterol” across these groups.\nIn order to run the analysis, I first extracted data from NHANES and merged it into one table that contains only the relevant variables.\n\n# 2017-2020\nhdl &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/HDL_L.xpt\")\nsmoking &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/SMQ_L.xpt\")\n\n# 2021-2023\nhdl2 &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/P_HDL.xpt\")\nsmoking2 &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/P_SMQ.xpt\")\n\n\nsmokers_old &lt;- hdl %&gt;%\n  inner_join(smoking, by = \"SEQN\") %&gt;%\n  filter(SMQ020 == 1 & !is.na(LBDHDD)) %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, LBDHDD, SMQ020)\n\nnonsmokers_new &lt;- hdl2 %&gt;%\n  inner_join(smoking2, by = \"SEQN\") %&gt;%\n  filter(SMQ020 == 2 & !is.na(LBDHDD)) %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, LBDHDD, SMQ020)\n\nsummary(smokers_old)\n\n      SEQN            LBDHDD           SMQ020 \n Min.   :130378   Min.   : 22.00   Min.   :1  \n 1st Qu.:133382   1st Qu.: 42.00   1st Qu.:1  \n Median :136473   Median : 51.00   Median :1  \n Mean   :136402   Mean   : 53.36   Mean   :1  \n 3rd Qu.:139386   3rd Qu.: 61.00   3rd Qu.:1  \n Max.   :142310   Max.   :138.00   Max.   :1  \n\nsummary(nonsmokers_new)\n\n      SEQN            LBDHDD           SMQ020 \n Min.   :109266   Min.   :  5.00   Min.   :2  \n 1st Qu.:113201   1st Qu.: 43.00   1st Qu.:2  \n Median :116955   Median : 52.00   Median :2  \n Mean   :117026   Mean   : 54.04   Mean   :2  \n 3rd Qu.:120885   3rd Qu.: 62.00   3rd Qu.:2  \n Max.   :124822   Max.   :141.00   Max.   :2  \n\n\n\nsmokers_old &lt;- smokers_old %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = \"Smokers\")\nnonsmokers_new &lt;- nonsmokers_new %&gt;%\n  mutate(Group = \"Nonsmokers\")\ncombined &lt;- bind_rows(smokers_old, nonsmokers_new)\nprint(combined)\n\n# A tibble: 7,200 × 4\n     SEQN LBDHDD SMQ020 Group  \n    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 130378     45      1 Smokers\n 2 130379     60      1 Smokers\n 3 130386     46      1 Smokers\n 4 130391     41      1 Smokers\n 5 130396     68      1 Smokers\n 6 130406     37      1 Smokers\n 7 130407     81      1 Smokers\n 8 130408     82      1 Smokers\n 9 130415     43      1 Smokers\n10 130437     37      1 Smokers\n# ℹ 7,190 more rows\n\n\nThese summary statistics reveal that the mean HDL cholesterol is slightly higher in non-smokers (54.04) compared to smokers (53.36). The median values for both groups (smokers: 51 mg/dL, non-smokers: 52 mg/dL) are slightly different as well.\nIn order to determine which method I wanted to use to build a confidence interval for the population mean difference, I decided to first assess normality by building a histogram and Q-Q plot of the differences between the two groups.\n\nqqnorm(combined$LBDHDD, main = \"QQ Plot: HDL Cholesterol Levels\")\nqqline(combined$LBDHDD, col = \"coral\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(combined$LBDHDD,\n     breaks = 30,\n     col = \"coral\",\n     main = \"Histogram: HDL Cholesterol Levels\",\n     xlab = \"HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)\",\n     border = \"darkred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the data is right-skewed and not normally distributed, I chose to proceed with the bootstrap approach to estimate a confidence interval for the population mean difference between the two groups.\n\ngroup_means &lt;- combined %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_HDL = mean(LBDHDD, na.rm = TRUE))\nmean_difference &lt;- group_means %&gt;%\n  summarize(difference = diff(mean_HDL)) %&gt;%\n  pull(difference)\n\nprint(mean_difference)\n\n[1] -0.6784084\n\n\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Hmisc'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    src, summarize\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    format.pval, units\n\nsmokers_HDL &lt;- combined %&gt;% filter(Group == \"Smokers\") %&gt;% pull(LBDHDD)\nnonsmokers_HDL &lt;- combined %&gt;% filter(Group == \"Nonsmokers\") %&gt;% pull(LBDHDD)\n\nset.seed(123)\nbootstrap_ci &lt;- smean.cl.boot(smokers_HDL - nonsmokers_HDL, B = 1000, conf.int = 0.90)\n\nWarning in smokers_HDL - nonsmokers_HDL: longer object length is not a multiple\nof shorter object length\n\nprint(bootstrap_ci)\n\n      Mean      Lower      Upper \n-0.6705120 -1.1510828 -0.1463267 \n\n\nBased on this analysis, on average, HDL cholesterol levels in non-smokers (2021-2023) are 0.67 mg/dL higher than in smokers (2017-2020), with a 90% confidence interval for the mean difference of -1.15 to -0.15 mg/dL. Since the CI does not include 0, this difference is considered statistically signficant and we can reject the null hypothesis.\nIn conclusion, this analysis suggests that there is a difference in HDL cholesterol levels between smokers and non-smokers. However, given how small the difference is, it likely has limited clinical relevance. I imagine there are other clinical factors that may play a bigger role in carcinogenesis.\nAnalysis B: Is there a meaningful difference in total cholesterol levels in those with and without a family history of cancer?\nThe independent variables I chose to compare for this analysis are total cholesterol levels (LBXTC) between those with and without a family history of cancer (MCQ220). I completed this analysis using NHANES 2021-2023 data.\nThe null hypothesis is that there is no differene in mean total cholesterol levels between those with and without a family history of cancer. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean total cholesterol levels between those with and without a family history of cancer. I suspect that those with a family history of cancer may have higher total cholesterol levels.\n\ncholesterol &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/TCHOL_L.xpt\")\nfhx &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/MCQ_L.xpt\")\n\n\ncholesterol &lt;- cholesterol %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, LBXTC) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(LBXTC))\nfhx &lt;- fhx %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, MCQ220) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(MCQ220) & MCQ220 %in% c(1,2)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Family_History = case_when(\n    MCQ220 == 1 ~ \"Yes\",\n    MCQ220 == 2 ~ \"No\"\n  ))\ncholesterol_fhx &lt;- cholesterol %&gt;%\n  inner_join(fhx, by = \"SEQN\")\nsummary(cholesterol_fhx)\n\n      SEQN            LBXTC           MCQ220      Family_History    \n Min.   :130378   Min.   : 62.0   Min.   :1.000   Length:5492       \n 1st Qu.:133348   1st Qu.:159.0   1st Qu.:2.000   Class :character  \n Median :136402   Median :185.0   Median :2.000   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :136355   Mean   :188.1   Mean   :1.852                     \n 3rd Qu.:139312   3rd Qu.:214.0   3rd Qu.:2.000                     \n Max.   :142310   Max.   :438.0   Max.   :2.000                     \n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(cholesterol_fhx, aes(x = LBXTC, fill = Family_History)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6, bins = 30) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Histogram of Total Cholesterol by Family History of Cancer\",\n    x = \"Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"coral\", \"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank()  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncholesterol_fhx %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(sample = LBXTC, color = Family_History)) +\n  stat_qq() +\n  stat_qq_line() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Q-Q Plot of Total Cholesterol\",\n    x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\",\n    y = \"Sample Quantiles\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the histogram and Q-Q plots, this data is not normally distributed.

Additionally, the p-value is 0.05, which lies right at the threshold of statistical significance.\n\nggplot(cholesterol_fhx, aes(x = Family_History, y = LBXTC, fill = Family_History)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Comparison of Total Cholesterol by Family History of Cancer\",\n    x = \"Family History of Cancer\",\n    y = \"Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"coral\", \"lightgreen\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank()  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, a median difference of 3 mg/dL is small.

This data was obtained from the most recent release of NHANES (2021-2023).\nI hypothesize that there will be significant differences in total cholesterol levels across racial/ethnic groups due to underlying factors, primarily related to genetic predisposition and social determinants of health.\n\nrace &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/DEMO_L.xpt\")\n\n\nrace &lt;- race %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, RIDRETH3) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(RIDRETH3))\n\ncholesterol_race &lt;- cholesterol_fhx %&gt;%\n  inner_join(race, by = \"SEQN\") %&gt;%  \n  mutate(\n    Race_Ethnicity = case_when(\n      RIDRETH3 == 1 ~ \"Mexican American\",\n      RIDRETH3 == 2 ~ \"Other Hispanic\",\n      RIDRETH3 == 3 ~ \"Non-Hispanic White\",\n      RIDRETH3 == 4 ~ \"Non-Hispanic Black\",\n      RIDRETH3 == 6 ~ \"Non-Hispanic Asian\",\n      RIDRETH3 == 7 ~ \"Other Race - Including Multi-Racial\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_  \n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Race_Ethnicity))\n\nsummary(cholesterol_race)\n\n      SEQN            LBXTC           MCQ220      Family_History    \n Min.   :130378   Min.   : 62.0   Min.   :1.000   Length:5492       \n 1st Qu.:133348   1st Qu.:159.0   1st Qu.:2.000   Class :character  \n Median :136402   Median :185.0   Median :2.000   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :136355   Mean   :188.1   Mean   :1.852                     \n 3rd Qu.:139312   3rd Qu.:214.0   3rd Qu.:2.000                     \n Max.   :142310   Max.   :438.0   Max.   :2.000                     \n    RIDRETH3     Race_Ethnicity    \n Min.   :1.000   Length:5492       \n 1st Qu.:3.000   Class :character  \n Median :3.000   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :3.289                     \n 3rd Qu.:3.000                     \n Max.   :7.000                     \n\n\nIn order to test for overall differences in mean cholesterol levels across race/ethnicity groups, I chose to run an ANOVA using Tukey’s HSD method.\n\ncholesterol_race &lt;- cholesterol_race %&gt;%\n  mutate(Race_Ethnicity = factor(Race_Ethnicity)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Race_Ethnicity = droplevels(Race_Ethnicity))\n\n\nanova(lm(LBXTC ~ Race_Ethnicity, data = cholesterol_race))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: LBXTC\n                 Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nRace_Ethnicity    5   84220 16844.0  9.3068 7.707e-09 ***\nResiduals      5486 9928951  1809.9                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe ANOVA results demonstrate high variance in total cholesterol levels between races, as indicated by an F-value of 9.3.

Non-Hispanic Asian compared to Mexican American individuals. 2. Non-Hispanic White compared to Non-Hispanic Black individuals. 3. Other Hispanic compared to Non-Hispanic Black and Other compared to Non-Hispanic Black individuals. Lower cholesterol levels were observed in: 5. Non-Hispanic Black compared to Mexican American individuals. 6. Non-Hispanic Black compared to Non-Hispanic Asian individuals.\nThese findings highlight disparities in total cholesterol between racial/ethnic groups. These likely represent a combination of factors, including genetics, dietary habits, socioeconomic factors, cultural practices, and other social determinants of health.\nI think the parallels between groups with higher disparities in total cholesterol and those who experience higher cancer mortality rates for certain cancers based on existing literature are interesting. I strongly believe that underlying socioeconomic factors that impact healthcare access (including preventative care) have profound impacts on the overall health of minority groups.\nAnalysis D: What is the association between health insurance coverage and cancer diagnosis?\nThe variables I chose to compare in this analysis are health insurance coverage(HIQ210) and cancer diagnosis (MCQ220). I hypothesize that individuals without insurance coverage are less likely to report a diagnosis of cancer compared to those with insurance due to diaprities in access to healthcare, resulting in delays in diagnosis.\n\ncancer &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/MCQ_L.xpt\")\nins &lt;- read_xpt(\"/Users/trishalal/Downloads/HIQ_L.xpt\")\ncancer &lt;- cancer %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, MCQ010) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(MCQ010)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Cancer_Diagnosis = case_when(\n    MCQ010 == 1 ~ \"Yes\",\n    MCQ010 == 2 ~ \"No\"\n  ))\n\nins &lt;- ins %&gt;%\n  select(SEQN, HIQ011) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(HIQ011)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Insurance = case_when(\n    HIQ011 == 1 ~ \"Yes\",\n    HIQ011 == 2 ~ \"No\"\n  ))\n\ncancer_ins &lt;- inner_join(cancer, ins, by = \"SEQN\")\n\nI wanted to make a 2x2 table to show the relationship between cancer diagnosis and insurance status.\n\ntable(cancer_ins$Cancer_Diagnosis, cancer_ins$Insurance)\n\n     \n        No  Yes\n  No   733 8998\n  Yes  126 1811\n\n\nIn general, it appears that most who have a cancer diagnosis have health insurance. It also appears that most who do not have a cancer diagnosis also have insurance.\n\nrisk_insured &lt;- 1811 / (1811 + 8998)  \nrisk_uninsured &lt;- 126 / (126 + 733)  \nRR &lt;- risk_insured / risk_uninsured\nprint(RR)\n\n[1] 1.142235\n\n\nIndividuals with insurance have a 14% greater relative risk of reporting a cancer diagnosis compared to uninsured individuals.\n\na &lt;- 1811\nb &lt;- 126\nc &lt;- 8998\nd &lt;- 733\nOR &lt;- (a * d) / (b * c)\nprint(OR)\n\n[1] 1.170862\n\n\nThe odds of being diagnosed with cancer are also 17% higher for insured individuals compared to uninsured individuals.\n\nRD &lt;- risk_insured - risk_uninsured\nprint(RD)\n\n[1] 0.02086338\n\n\nA risk difference of 0.02 indicates that there is a 2.0% higher risk of cancer diagnosis for insured individuals than uninsured individuals.\nIn conclusion, these findings suggest that insured individuals are slightly more likely to report a cancer diagnosis compared to uninsured individuals. This can likely be attributed to the role that insurance plays in facilitating access to diagnostic services and preventative care, which improve the early detection of cancer. These findings again highlight the importance of addressing disparities to care in cancer."

The full model also has better AIC and BIC scores, indicating that it is a better fit for our model development sample compared to the subset model.\nHoldout-sample assessment: In order to assess the predictive quality of the models, I ran some tests in the training (holdout) sample.\n\nholdout_sample &lt;- test_sample \n\nholdout_sample$pred_full &lt;- predict(full_model, newdata = holdout_sample)\nholdout_sample$pred_subset &lt;- predict(subset_model, newdata = holdout_sample)\n\nFirst, I calculated the RMSE (Root Mean Square Deviation) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of both models.\n\nlibrary(Metrics)\n\nrmse_full &lt;- rmse(holdout_sample$LBXTC, holdout_sample$pred_full)\nmae_full &lt;- mae(holdout_sample$LBXTC, holdout_sample$pred_full)\n\nrmse_subset &lt;- rmse(holdout_sample$LBXTC, holdout_sample$pred_subset)\nmae_subset &lt;- mae(holdout_sample$LBXTC, holdout_sample$pred_subset)\n\ncat(\"Full Model - RMSE:\", rmse_full, \"MAE:\", mae_full, \"\\n\")\n\nFull Model - RMSE: 181.7983 MAE: 177.1574 \n\ncat(\"Subset Model - RMSE:\", rmse_subset, \"MAE:\", mae_subset, \"\\n\")\n\nSubset Model - RMSE: 181.7981 MAE: 177.1567 \n\n\nBoth models have nearly identical RMSE and MAE. These values suggest that the models have poor predictive performance in terms of detecting precise outcomes. Interestingly, however, the subset model achieves the ssame predictive performance despite including only the key predictor.\nNext, I created residuals and calibration plots:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(holdout_sample, aes(x = pred_full, y = LBXTC - pred_full)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(title = \"Residuals vs Fitted (Full Model)\", x = \"Predicted\", y = \"Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(holdout_sample, aes(x = pred_full, y = LBXTC)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(title = \"Calibration Plot (Full Model)\", x = \"Predicted\", y = \"Observed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals plot showed uneven distribution of the residuals, indicating that there is evidence of heteroscedasticity in both models. The calibration plot showed that predicted values are close to observed values. However, clustering suggests that our models have limited predictive power.\nThe bottom line is that both models have nearly identical predictive performance and quality. Given that information, I prefer the subset model because it is simpler, yet still has similar performance metrics as the full model. Despite the AIC and BIC being slightly better in the full model, I believe that prioritizing parsimony would ensure that our model is not overly complex for minimal additional benefit when it comes to practical applications.\nAs a reminder, the research question we tried to answer is: How effectively does race/ethnicity predict total cholesterol levels? What happens when we adjust for insurance status, smoking status, and family history of cancer?\nBased on both models, race/ethnicity do contribute to differences in total cholesterol levels. For example, when evaluating the log-transformed subset model, certain groups have higher predicted total cholesterol levels, such as Non-Hispanic Asians and non-Hispanic White, compared to the reference group (Mexican-Americans). The effect size of these is small, however.\nWhen we adjust for other predictors like insurance status, smoking status, and family history, the predictive power of the model improves only slightly, as discussed previously.\nThere are several limitations to be discussed. Firstly, the data obtained from NHANES may not represent the general population. Certain groups may be over- or undersampled, which is important to note when looking at race/ethnicity in particular. Additionally, both models have low R-squared values, which means that only a small proportion of the variance in cholesterol levels can be explained by the predictors we are evaluating in this study. Finally, there are unmeasured variables that could have confounded the observed relationship between the predictors and total cholesterol levels. These include dietary habits, physical activity, and genetics.\nNext steps involve adding these other known risk factors to create a more robust analysis. It could also be more helpful to use a larger, more diverse dataset to improve the external validity of this study."

    "text": "The Association between Social Vulnerability and the Incidence of Early vs. Late-Stage Melanoma\nThis is one of my first clinical research projects. I am currently writing a manuscript based on my analyses and aim to have it submitted by the end of October 2024. Once that is completed, I have ideas for several other projects stemming from this overarching topic: geospatial analyses of this subject across various geographic regions in the US, classification and regression tree analysis to determine susceptible phenotypes, and evaluation of other melanoma risk factors on early- vs. late-stage disease incidence."

    "text": "Provider Perceptions of Barriers to Care for GI Cancer Patients\nThis project started this past summer with a survey sent to various healthcare providers caring for patients with GI cancers at UH. There was an excellent response rate, which has led me to be able to conduct thorough descriptive statistical analyses of the results. I am working on generating a manuscript that summarizes our findings. The following steps will include conducting provider interviews to build on our survey data and eventual patient interviews to understand both perspectives better. This will require several more rounds of analysis and manuscript writing. Additionally, I aim to present this work at various conferences along the way, ranging from UH Research and Innovation Day this October to the ASCO GI symposium in January 2025 to the annual Health Disparities Symposium held at UH in 2026. My ultimate goal is to be able to bring our findings to administrative staff at UH to implement specific policy changes to mitigate barriers as perceived by providers and patients.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
